# Machine-Learning-for-Cat-and-Dog-Classification
This repository demonstrates a complete workflow for classifying cat and dog images using machine learning. It covers data preprocessing, training models (SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, CNN, and K-means), and building a Flask-based web application with an interactive frontend for image upload and classification.
